##For professors

Dear professor, 

I continously have pushed my code into git. The reason 
is that if anything happens to my laptop I would still 
have a backup plan. Therefore, you may find some git 
folders in it. 
You will also have the r.sh file. If you are on linux
you can run it with bash and it will compile the code 
if you have gcc installed.
I have only tested my code in linux with the gcc com-
piler.

Respectfully,
